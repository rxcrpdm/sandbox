Why are you interested in joining the Inspirit AI Scholars program?

I first got fascinated in Artificial Intelligence after watching the movie "A.I". The idea that a machine can think and act like a human being intrigued me a lot, and ever since I always dreamt of doing some research in this area. I have read a quite a bit of popular science articles to know more about this field. What I have come to know is that AI can be applied to every sector of human endeavor to enable new possibilities. After taking the AP Computer Science course where I learnt how to write programs, my interest has grown even further in this field because I was always thinking how to write a program that is capable of learning and reasoning like a human being. My interest in joining the Inspirit AI Scholars program is to get an oppurtunity to explore this fascinating scientific field, and to know what new inventions are being made.
